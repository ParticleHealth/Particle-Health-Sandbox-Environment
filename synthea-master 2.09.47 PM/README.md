# Synthea<sup>TM</sup> Patient Generator [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/synthetichealth/synthea.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/synthetichealth/synthea) [![codecov](https://codecov.io/gh/synthetichealth/synthea/branch/master/graph/badge.svg)](https://codecov.io/gh/synthetichealth/synthea)

Synthea<sup>TM</sup> is a Synthetic Patient Population Simulator. The goal is to output synthetic, realistic (but not real), patient data and associated health records in a variety of formats.

Read our [wiki](https://github.com/synthetichealth/synthea/wiki) for more information.

Currently, Synthea<sup>TM</sup> features include:
- Birth to Death Lifecycle
- Configuration-based statistics and demographics (defaults with Massachusetts Census data)
- Modular Rule System
  - Drop in [Generic Modules](https://github.com/synthetichealth/synthea/wiki/Generic-Module-Framework)
  - Custom Java rules modules for additional capabilities
- Primary Care Encounters, Emergency Room Encounters, and Symptom-Driven Encounters
- Conditions, Allergies, Medications, Vaccinations, Observations/Vitals, Labs, Procedures, CarePlans
- Formats
  - HL7 FHIR (STU3 v3.0.1, DSTU2 v1.0.2 and R4)
  - Bulk FHIR in ndjson format (set `exporter.fhir.bulk_data = true` to activate)
  - C-CDA (set `exporter.ccda.export = true` to activate)
  - CSV (set `exporter.csv.export = true` to activate)
  - CPCDS (set `exporter.cpcds.export = true` to activate)
- Rendering Rules and Disease Modules with Graphviz

## Developer Quick Start

These instructions are intended for those wishing to examine the Synthea source code, extend it or build the code locally. Those just wishing to run Synthea should follow the [Basic Setup and Running](https://github.com/synthetichealth/synthea/wiki/Basic-Setup-and-Running) instructions instead.

### Installation

**System Requirements:**
Synthea<sup>TM</sup> requires Java 1.8 or above.

To clone the Synthea<sup>TM</sup> repo, then build and run the test suite:
```
git clone https://github.com/synthetichealth/synthea.git
cd synthea
./gradlew build check test
```

### Changing the default properties 


The default properties file values can be found at `src/main/resources/synthea.properties`.
By default, synthea does not generate CCDA, CPCDA, CSV, or Bulk FHIR (ndjson). You'll need to
adjust this file to activate these features.  See the [wiki](https://github.com/synthetichealth/synthea/wiki)
for more details.



### Generate Synthetic Patients
Generating the population one at a time...
```
./run_synthea
```

Command-line arguments may be provided to specify a state, city, population size, or seed for randomization.

Usage is 
```
run_synthea [-s seed] [-p populationSize] [-m moduleFilter] [state [city]]
```
For example:

 - `run_synthea Massachusetts`
 - `run_synthea Alaska Juneau`
 - `run_synthea -s 12345`
 - `run_synthea -p 1000`
 - `run_synthea -s 987 Washington Seattle`
 - `run_synthea -s 21 -p 100 Utah "Salt Lake City"`
 - `run_synthea -m metabolic*`

Some settings can be changed in `./src/main/resources/synthea.properties`.

Synthea<sup>TM</sup> will output patient records in C-CDA and FHIR formats in `./output`.

### Synthea<sup>TM</sup> GraphViz
Generate graphical visualizations of Synthea<sup>TM</sup> rules and modules.
```
./gradlew graphviz
```

### Concepts and Attributes
Generate a list of concepts (used in the records) or attributes (variables on each patient).
```
./gradlew concepts
./gradlew attributes
```
